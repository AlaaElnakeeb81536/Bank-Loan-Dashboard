# Bank-Loan-Dashboard
Power BI Dashboard – Bank Loan Analysis

Built an interactive dashboard to analyze loan performance.

Implemented KPIs including: total loans, funded amount, received amount, MoM & MTD changes.

Segmented loans into Good vs Bad using DAX logic based on loan status.

Designed visual insights: donut charts, bar charts, time-series trends, and category breakdowns (grade, home ownership).

Created DAX measures for percentage distribution and financial calculations.
